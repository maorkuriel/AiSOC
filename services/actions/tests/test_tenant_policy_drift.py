"""Dispatch re-checks the evidence behind a grant, using the shared evaluator.

Fix pass item 3.7. See ``plans/aisoc_fix_pass_plan.plan.md``.

``state = 'granted'`` is a cached verdict, and the only thing that moved a
grant out of it was ``reconcile_grants`` in ``services/api`` — whose single
production caller was the handler behind ``GET /autonomy-policy/grants``. So a
tenant whose agreement had collapsed kept auto-executing containment until
somebody opened a page, which on an unattended deployment is never.

The behaviour lives in ``tests/isolation/test_autonomy_drift_at_dispatch_live.py``,
against a real Postgres, because the thing worth proving is that the aggregate
and the evaluator agree about real rows. What is here is what does not need a
database: that the parameters match the statements, and that the decision is
the shared evaluator's rather than a second opinion written locally.
