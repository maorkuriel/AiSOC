"""The route that lets this bot start a conversation.

Reproduce: before this, every route here was inbound. Teams posted an
``invoke`` activity, the bot verified the signed card payload and answered —
so it could answer a question and could not ask one, and the documented
"an agent stops and asks Teams for approval" flow could only begin with a
person typing first. The card builder and the signed callback handler were
both written and both reachable only from a conversation a human started.
