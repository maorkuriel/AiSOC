"""Stateful / windowed detection engine (Wave 2).

The live :class:`app.services.detection_engine.DetectionEngine` is stateless: it
matches one event at a time. Whole classes of real attacks are only visible
across MULTIPLE events in a time window — brute force, password spray, port
scans, data-staging bursts. This engine adds sliding-window threshold detection:
count events matching a rule, grouped by an entity, and fire once when the count
crosses a threshold inside the window.

State lives in Redis sorted sets (member = event id, score = epoch seconds) so
the window is a cheap ``ZREMRANGEBYSCORE`` + ``ZCARD``, and a short-lived
"fired" marker suppresses duplicate alerts for the same window. Everything is
fail-soft: a Redis outage degrades to "windowed detections are skipped for the
outage", never crashing the fusion pipeline.

Only security-relevant bursts fire — a benign event that doesn't match a rule's
``match_when`` never even touches Redis.
