"""Every translated windowed rule, replayed through the real engine.

Why this file and not a comparison against the exporter
-------------------------------------------------------
``scripts/check_windowed_translation.py`` proves a translation matches the
``det-*`` rule it came from. That is a statement about two pieces of JSON. It
cannot tell you the rule fires, and the corpus already contains the lesson:
the 74 rules this work translated passed fixture replay for years while being
unable to fire, because their fixtures were synthesised from the rule and
replayed against the same clauses.

So this drives the real :class:`WindowedDetectionEngine`, with the committed
ruleset, over events built from each rule's own selector, and asserts the
threshold boundary:

* ``threshold`` matching events fire the rule;
* ``threshold - 1`` do not — the one assertion a synthesised fixture can never
  make, because a stateless fixture has no notion of "one short";
* an event that fails the selector never counts, so a rule cannot be fired by
  traffic it does not select;
* two entities accumulate separately, so the grouping is real rather than a
  global counter wearing an entity's name.

"Fires" here means what it means everywhere else in this tree: replayed
through the real engine on a well-formed event of its log source and observed
to cross its threshold. It is not a claim that the rule detects an attack.
