package normalizer

// OCSF event classes, and which one each connector type's telemetry is.
//
// Every uid, caption and category below was read from the published schema
// before it was used here, not recalled:
//
//	https://schema.ocsf.io/api/1.9.0/classes   (the version the tree targets)
//	https://schema.ocsf.io/api/1.1.0/classes   (the version metadata.version declares)
//
// Both were checked because the two numbers are not the same thing. The
// normalizer stamps `metadata.version: 1.1.0` as its contract with
// connectors, while the evidence bundle declares 1.9.0
// (`docs/architecture/evidence-bundles.md`), and emitting a class that exists
// only in the newer schema under the older version string would be a false
// claim about a public standard. Every class named here carries the same uid,
// caption and category in both, so the question does not arise — but it was
// asked, and it is why this file lists two URLs rather than one.
//
// Why a connector's class is load-bearing rather than cosmetic
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// `should_promote()` in services/fusion/app/services/promoter.py promotes an
// event to an alert when it is OCSF category 2 (Findings) **or** its
// severity_id is at least 4. The category is the class uid divided by a
// thousand, so the class a connector's events carry decides whether its
// routine telemetry reaches an analyst's queue or stays in the lake.
//
// Before this table, every connector without a hand-written profile landed on
// 2001 Security Finding through `canonicalProfile` — category 2, therefore
// always promoted. For the connectors whose fetch_alerts really does return
// vendor findings that is right. For the ones returning raw telemetry it
// meant every permitted DNS lookup, every allowed proxy request, every
// accepted VPC flow record and every routine Windows event became an alert
// carrying severity "info": the alert-reduction property fusion exists to
// provide, inverted, for the sources that emit the most volume.
//
// The split mirrors the one `ai_runtime` and `ai_guardrail` already make in
// normalizer.go, for the same stated reason: routine activity at a category
// the promoter leaves alone, judged findings at category 2.
//
// How a connector's class was chosen
// ----------------------------------
// By what its `fetch_alerts` actually returns, read from the connector rather
// than inferred from the vendor's product category — the two disagree often
// enough that guessing would have demoted four sources that only ever return
// findings. Netskope's connector reads `/api/v2/events/data/alert` and
// Proofpoint's reads `/v2/siem/messages/blocked`, so both return judgements
// and keep category 2; Zscaler's reads web logs with `action: "any"` and
// Cisco Umbrella's reads `/activity`, so both are telemetry and take their
// activity class. Where a stream is genuinely mixed the class covering the
// security-relevant majority is used and the entry says so.

// OCSF class uids this service may emit. Named rather than spelled inline so
// the gate reads one table and a reader can see the category each implies
// (uid/1000), which is what decides promotion.
