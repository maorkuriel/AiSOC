"""ABAC conditions, elevation and workload identities, offline.

Depth plan item 8.2. The live half is
``tests/isolation/test_abac_elevation_live.py``, which drives real routes
against real Postgres; this half covers the decisions that do not need a
database and the two vocabularies that have to agree with each other.

What this file cannot prove, and says so
-----------------------------------------
That the tables have readers. A fake session answers any query, which is
the exact shape that let three tables ship with no reader and every
offline suite stay green. Everything here is about *shape*: given a
principal already carrying grants and conditions, does the one permission
path reach the right verdict.
