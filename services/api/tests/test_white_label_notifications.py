"""The signed email approval is wired, and it carries the operator's brand.

Two defects, one path.

``send_approval_email`` had **no caller anywhere in the tree**. The
documentation names it as the fallback for "Slack and Teams are unreachable",
and the function, its signer, its verifier and its consuming endpoint were all
tested — none of which says anything about whether an approval ever produces
one. So these cases drive ``POST /api/v1/approvals`` through the real router
and read what left the mailer, rather than calling the function and asserting
it returns what it was given.

The second is why that matters here: the subject line read ``[AiSOC]`` for
every organisation, and ``sender_name`` — the one resolved field whose entire
purpose is naming who mail comes from — was read by nothing. A managed
customer's on-call analyst is the person this lands on, and they have never
heard of the platform their provider runs.

The link is verified rather than eyeballed. A branded email whose approve
button does not authenticate is worse than an unbranded one, and the
consuming endpoint refuses a token that names no approver — which is exactly
what this function minted while nothing called it.
