"""Scoring for replay evaluation: the agent against a customer's own analysts.

Gap-closure Phase 1.3.

This extends the benchmark package rather than standing beside it. The
hallucination machinery is :func:`aisoc_benchmark.metrics.is_checkable_indicator`
and :func:`~aisoc_benchmark.metrics.extract_checkable_indicators`, unchanged, so
an indicator counted here is one the synthetic-corpus grader would also have
counted. A second grader would eventually disagree with the first about what
"hallucinated" means, and the published numbers would stop being comparable
while still looking like they were.

What replay measures that the synthetic corpus cannot
------------------------------------------------------
The synthetic corpus has balanced classes by construction. A real queue does
not: most closed findings are false positives, and a handful are the ones that
mattered. Three consequences shape this module.

**Headline accuracy is withheld on a thin corpus.** Below
:data:`MIN_MALICIOUS_FOR_HEADLINE` true positives the report prints the count
and refuses the number. Accuracy over 200 findings of which three were
malicious is 98% for an agent that calls everything benign, and publishing
that figure would be actively misleading in the direction that sells.

**Recall on malicious leads.** It is the number an operator is actually
deciding on, and it is the one an imbalanced corpus hides. :class:`ReplayScore`
puts it first and the renderers keep that order.

**Every mean travels with the count it was computed over.** A precision of
1.00 across two predictions is not a precision of 1.00 across two hundred, and
a table that prints only the ratio has thrown away the distinction.

Absent is not zero
------------------
A rate with no denominator is ``None`` and renders as "not measured". This is
not fussiness: ``0.0`` in a precision column reads as "the agent got every one
of these wrong", and "the agent never predicted this class" is a different
fact with a different remedy.

Determinism
-----------
Bootstrap confidence intervals resample, so they need a source of randomness,
and a report that has to reproduce byte for byte cannot have an unseeded one.
:data:`BOOTSTRAP_SEED` fixes it, :class:`ReplayScore` records the seed and the
resample count it used, and :func:`score_replay` takes both as arguments so a
caller who wants a different interval can ask for one and have the report say
so.
