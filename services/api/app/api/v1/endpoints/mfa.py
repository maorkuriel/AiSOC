"""A second factor for the desktop console: enrolment, challenge, policy, reset.

Fix pass 4.2.

`POST /auth/login` verified a password and returned a token pair, and
nothing a user or an administrator could do made that insufficient.
Passkeys existed on `/responder/*` only, so the surface an analyst works
from all day was single-factor by construction.

The flow
--------
**Enrolment** (already signed in, or holding an enrolment challenge):

1. ``POST /auth/mfa/enroll/begin``   → a secret and an ``otpauth://`` URI
2. ``POST /auth/mfa/enroll/confirm`` → a code from that secret; returns the
   recovery codes, which exist in plaintext exactly once

**Sign-in**:

1. ``POST /auth/login`` with a correct password answers **202** and a
   short-lived challenge token instead of a session
2. ``POST /auth/mfa/verify`` with that token and a code (or a recovery
   code) returns the ordinary token pair

The 202 is deliberate. Extending the 200 body would have made
``access_token`` optional, which `scripts/openapi_diff.py` correctly calls
a break for every generated client; a 401 would collide with the console's
own ``handleUnauthorized``, which clears storage and bounces to `/login`.
202 reads as what it is — the credentials were accepted, something remains
to be done — and `fetch` treats it as a success, so the console reads the
body rather than an exception.

The challenge token
-------------------
Signed with ``SECRET_KEY`` like every other token, carrying
``type: "mfa_challenge"``. `get_current_user` requires ``type == "access"``,
so this authenticates no route: it is only an argument to the two handlers
below that look for it.

Enrolling under a policy you have not yet satisfied
---------------------------------------------------
When a tenant turns enforcement on, every user who has not enrolled holds
a correct password and no second factor. Refusing them outright locks out
the whole tenant at once, so the challenge token issued in that case
carries ``purpose: "enroll"`` and the two enrolment handlers accept it.

The trade-off is explicit: somebody who has stolen a password can enrol
*their own* authenticator before the real user does. It is bounded by the
password still being required, by the window being only until the real
user enrols, and by `mfa.enrolled` being audited with the source address —
and it is the trade every product that rolls MFA out to an existing user
base makes. The alternative, an administrator-issued enrolment ticket per
user, is a reasonable future addition and not a reason to ship a flow that
bricks a tenant.
