"""Attribute conditions that narrow a permission.

Depth plan item 8.2. ``permission_conditions`` was created by migration 087
and read by nothing, so ``cases:write`` was true everywhere, always, from
any address: there was no way to say "from the corporate network" or "during
this incident".

Enforcement does not live here
------------------------------
These routes administer rows. The rows are applied by
``CurrentUser.require_permission`` in ``app/api/v1/deps.py``, inside the one
permission path, after whichever branch allowed. That placement is the
design, not an implementation detail: a condition evaluated *beside* the
permission check would be a second authorization system, and two authorities
that can disagree is the shape that produced GHSA-pm3f-h6gc-rvgp here.

Why the operator set is narrower than the evaluator's
------------------------------------------------------
``app.security.abac`` implements eight operators. This surface accepts the
subset whose attributes the API actually puts in the evaluation context
today. The rest are refused at write time with the reason, rather than
stored and silently denied at read time: a condition the deployment cannot
evaluate is indeterminate, indeterminate denies, and an operator who
configured one would see a permanent 403 with nothing explaining it.

``mfa_satisfied`` is the one that matters. Console MFA is being built
separately; until the authenticated principal carries that fact, a condition
naming it would be a control the tree does not have.

    a reason the console attributes to a rule they cannot edit.
