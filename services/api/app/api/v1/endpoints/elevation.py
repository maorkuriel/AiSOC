"""Time-boxed privilege elevation: request, approve, expire.

Depth plan item 8.2. ``privilege_grants`` was created by migration 087 and
read by nothing, so there was no elevation at all: a role was held
permanently or not at all, and an analyst who needed to isolate a host once
either held that power every day or waited for somebody who did.

The three properties that make this least privilege rather than paperwork
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Permissions, not roles.** Elevating to ``admin`` to isolate one host
confers the wildcard. A grant names the permissions it confers and nothing
else.

**The approver must already hold what they confer.** Enforced by
:func:`app.core.role_grants.authorize_permission_grant`, the same function
that guards role assignment and API-key scopes — scoped to the granter
rather than enumerated per call site, because an allow-list per route means
the next route written is a new advisory (GHSA-pm3f-h6gc-rvgp).

**Nobody approves their own.** Otherwise a request is a grant with extra
steps, and the whole control is a log line.

Expiry needs no worker
----------------------
``expires_at`` is checked where the grant is *used*, in
``CurrentUser.elevated_permissions``. A sweep job is a job that can be
down, and a grant outliving its window because a worker crashed is the
failure mode this exists to remove. Revocation writes ``revoked_at`` and
bumps the RBAC version so every replica drops the grant on its next
request rather than when its TTL happens to lapse.
