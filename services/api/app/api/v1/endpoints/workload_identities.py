"""Per-service credentials for internal callers.

Depth plan item 8.2. ``workload_identities`` was created by migration 087
and read by nothing, leaving ``AISOC_SERVICE_TOKEN`` — one string every
internal caller presents — as the only internal credential.

Deployment-wide, and therefore not tenant-scoped
-------------------------------------------------
A service authenticates *before* any tenant is known; the agents container
triages alerts for every tenant on the deployment and names the one it is
acting for on a header, per request. So these rows carry no ``tenant_id``,
and the table has no row-level security policy — the migration says so and
means it.

That makes minting one a platform act rather than a tenant act, which is
why the permissions below are held only by the wildcard roles
(``admin`` and ``platform_admin``). That is deliberate and is the one case
where "no non-wildcard role holds this" is the right answer rather than
the bug it usually is: a tenant administrator minting a credential that
every tenant's data flows through would be precisely the cross-tenant
authority this feature exists to remove.

Scopes are still bounded by the minter
---------------------------------------
``authorize_permission_grant`` refuses a scope the caller does not hold,
the same function that guards role assignment and API-key scopes. A
wildcard principal may mint a wildcard workload — it confers nothing they
do not already have — and anybody else is held to what they hold.
