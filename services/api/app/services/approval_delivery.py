"""Put a pending approval in front of a person, on the channels configured.

``POST /approvals`` persisted the row and fanned out one Web Push
notification. Everything else that was supposed to reach an approver had
been built and connected to nothing:

* ``services/api/app/services/email_approval.py`` holds the token issuer,
  the verifier, the renderer and ``send_approval_email`` — and the sender
  had **no caller anywhere in the tree**. The decide route
  (``/approvals/email/decide``) has been live the whole time waiting for a
  link nothing ever sent.
* ``services/teams-bot`` holds the Adaptive Card builder and the signed
  callback handler, and the service is not in any compose file, so nothing
  could post a card even if something tried.
* ``services/slack-bot`` grew ``POST /internal/approval-card`` for exactly
  this and is reached from here for the first time.

Why a fan-out module rather than three calls in the route
----------------------------------------------------------
Each channel has its own failure mode and none of them may fail the
request: the approval is already durable in Postgres by the time this runs,
and the console and the responder app can both act on it. A channel that is
down must leave a record saying so, not take the approval with it. That is
easier to get right — and much easier to test — in one place with one rule
than in three ``try``/``except`` blocks in a route handler.

Off by default, per channel
---------------------------
A channel delivers only when it is configured: no SMTP relay, no email; no
``AISOC_SLACK_BOT_URL``, no card; no ``AISOC_TEAMS_BOT_URL``, no Teams. An
unconfigured channel reports ``skipped`` with the setting that would turn it
on, which is the difference between "we chose not to" and "it broke".
