"""The one place this service puts a message on a wire to a person.

Three features in depth 5.2 need to send mail — scheduled reports, the
weekly digest, and the one-click approval email whose issuer and verifier
have shipped since parity 5.2 with nothing calling the sender. One sender
rather than three, because a second copy is a second place for TLS, the
envelope sender and the "did it actually go" answer to be slightly
different, and the generous copy is the one that ends up used.

Off by default
--------------
No ``SMTP_HOST`` means disabled, and disabled is reported as ``skipped``
with a reason rather than as a success. A product that silently starts
emailing a customer's analysts on upgrade is the failure this rule exists
to prevent, and the honest no-op is what lets a caller say "a report was
generated and not delivered, because no relay is configured" instead of
pretending it landed.

``smtplib``, not a dependency
----------------------------
The send blocks, so it runs in a worker thread. ``aiosmtplib`` would be the
obvious alternative and is not worth a new dependency in the service that
already carries the most: the call is one connection, one message, and the
thread pool is where a blocking library belongs.

What it does not do
-------------------
Queue, retry or deduplicate. A caller that needs those has them already —
``outbound_webhooks`` carries its own retry ladder and dead-letter table —
and burying a retry loop here would make every caller inherit a policy none
of them chose.
