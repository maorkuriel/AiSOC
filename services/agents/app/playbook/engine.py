"""
Playbook Engine — Pillar 2
==========================
Executes an AiSOC Playbook against a trigger context (alert/case dict).

Design goals:
- Async, step-by-step execution with per-step structured logging.
- Supports condition gates, on_failure policies, and basic retries.
- Emits events to the realtime service so the UI can stream progress.
- Zero external dependencies beyond httpx + stdlib.

# Response steps — the bridge to governed dispatch
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Fifteen step types name a verb that changes somebody's estate. Three of them
# used to be answered here with ``{"simulated": True}`` and reached no executor
# at all; the other twelve had no handler. `services/actions` has held working
# executors for fourteen of the fifteen the whole time, behind a contract that
# declares each verb's impact, reversibility, approval requirement and whether
# a probe exists to confirm the effect landed.
#
# Each of these steps is now one governed dispatch, graded on its own
# capability. A playbook is not approved as a unit: authorising the playbook
# cannot authorise whatever its steps happen to contain, because the contract
# is applied per step at the far end.
#
# `approval` is the one verb that is not bridged, and the reason is recorded
# at its entry in ``_UNBRIDGEABLE`` rather than papered over with a handler.


#: Where each verb's target lives, in the order it should be looked for:
#: first the step's own params, then the trigger context. A verb with no
#: natural scalar target (the details ride in ``params``) maps to ``()``.

#
# A playbook could branch and it could not wait, fan out or repeat. So
# "contain, then re-check in five minutes", "revoke every session this user
# holds" and "ask three vendors at once" each had to be hand-unrolled into a
# fixed chain of steps, which is why none of the 62 shipped packs attempts
# any of them.
#
# Three properties the three steps share, each of which has an opposite that
# would be worse than not having the step at all:
#
# * **Bounded.** A playbook is author-supplied and these are the first steps
#   that multiply work. Iterations, fan-out and nesting all have ceilings in
#   `bounds.py`, and the ceiling is reported in the result rather than
#   silently truncating.
# * **Honest when empty.** A `parallel` or `loop` with no children, or a
#   `loop` over a path that resolved to nothing, fails rather than reporting
#   a success for work it did not do. That is the same rule the missing-
#   handler branch below exists to enforce.
# * **Idempotent per execution.** Every child carries a key derived from its
#   coordinates, so the third iteration is distinguishable from the fourth
#   and a resumed run reproduces the same keys. See `idempotency.py`.
