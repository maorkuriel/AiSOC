"""Suspend a playbook run at an approval step, and resume it on the decision.

Parity plan 5.2.

What was wrong
--------------
The engine is a single-threaded index walk with no pause and no resume, so
an `approval` step had nothing to suspend. It failed closed, which was the
right interim behaviour: before that it returned `{"skipped": true}` while
reporting SUCCESS, so a run continued straight into the very action a human
was supposed to authorise. But failing closed means **12 shipped playbooks
abort at their approval step**, which is not an approval mechanism either.

Three properties the plan requires, and what each costs
--------------------------------------------------------
* **Resumes from `/approvals/{id}/decide`.** The route already exists and
  already persists to `agent_approvals`; what was missing is anything on
  the engine side to wake.
* **Survives restarts.** So the position and the context go to Postgres,
  not to a process. An in-memory pause is lost by exactly the thing most
  likely to interrupt a long-running approval.
* **Expires with a recorded outcome.** `expired` is a decision, not an
  absence of one. A pause with no expiry is a run that hangs forever and
  an operator who never learns it did.

What a resumed run must not do
------------------------------
Re-run the approval step. The stored index is the step *itself* and resume
advances past it, so a replayed decision (a double-tap in the responder
app, a retried webhook) continues rather than pausing again.
