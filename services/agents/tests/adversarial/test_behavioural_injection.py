"""Verdict flip rate and unsafe-action rate, per injection family.

Parity plan 3.3.

What this measures, exactly
---------------------------
Not whether a model resists injection. There is no funded hosted key, and
a locally-served small model would make every number a property of that
model on that machine. The model here is a deliberately **obedient** stub
that follows any instruction it finds, so what is measured is whether the
pipeline around the model (the prompt envelope, the injection guard, the
L0 demotion) stops an obedient model from being steered.

An obedient model is the attacker's best case, so these rates are an
**upper bound on harm**, not an estimate of real-world behaviour. The
report carries `llm_resistance_measured: false` so no reader can take it
for a model evaluation.

The floor, and why it is not tightened here
-------------------------------------------
The recorded floor is the measurement as taken, not a target. Tightening
the guard against this corpus in the same change would raise the number
without closing the threat: that has been measured here before, where
hardening moved a tuned corpus from 66.7% to 98.1% while held-out payloads
moved only 3.6% to 7.1%. So the corpus and the floor land first, the guard
changes in a later commit, and both numbers get published.

That is what happened to `fake_tool_output`, which this suite recorded at
1.0 and depth plan 1.3 then closed. **This file now measures the corpus the
fix was written against**, which answers "did the change do what it was
written to do" and not "is the threat closed". The second question belongs
to `test_behavioural_holdout.py`, whose payloads were authored after the fix
was frozen, and the two numbers are published side by side.

#: suite fails when behaviour gets **worse**.

#: These are deliberately the numbers as taken rather than rounded-up
#: headroom, because a floor with slack in it stops being a ratchet. The
#: unsafe-action ceiling is a hard zero for the same reason: the single
#: payload that ever reached an action did so through the fabricated-tool-
#: output family, and an injected containment turns the SOC into a
#: denial-of-service tool pointed at its own estate, so a recurrence should
#: fail rather than fit inside headroom somebody budgeted for.
