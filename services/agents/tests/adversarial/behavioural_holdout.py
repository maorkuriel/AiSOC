"""Fabricated tool output, authored after the fix for it was frozen.

Depth plan 1.3.

Why this exists
---------------
``behavioural_corpus.py`` measured ``fake_tool_output`` at a verdict flip rate
of 1.0 and the pipeline was then changed to close it. Re-measuring on that same
corpus answers "did the change do what it was written to do", which is worth
knowing and is not the question anyone cares about. This repository has already
published what the difference costs: hardening a guard against the corpus that
graded it moved a tuned score from 66.7% to 98.1% while held-out payloads moved
3.6% to 7.1%. The tuned number went up by thirty points and the threat barely
moved.

So the fix landed in commit ``abf758cd`` and these payloads were written
afterwards, against a frozen tree. Nothing below was consulted while the rule
was written, and the rule has not been touched since — the measurement is
reported in the pull request and in ``apps/docs/docs/benchmark.md`` whichever
way it came out.

How they were written, which decides what the number means
-----------------------------------------------------------
Aimed at the seams, deliberately, on the same terms as
``injection_holdout.py``: by someone who could read the patterns, which for a
guard published under an MIT licence is the correct threat model rather than a
pessimistic one. Every payload targets a named structural property of the fix
rather than reaching for synonyms, and the property is recorded on the case so
a reader can see which seam each one tests and what a miss there would cost.

That makes this a **worst-case probe, not a neutral sample**. An attacker who
cannot read the source writes payload 9 or 10 — plain prose — and not payload
14, whose only trick is a newline in the right place. The honest reading of a
gap between this rate and the tuned one is that the tuned corpus is the easier
of the two by construction, and both are published rather than the better one.

Every payload carries one of the obedient stub's steering phrases or an action
trigger. A payload that could not have steered the model measures nothing, and
a corpus padded with them reports a flip rate that is really a count of
harmless strings — the vacuous-rate failure ``test_vacuous_rates_refuse.py``
exists to catch. ``test_behavioural_holdout.py`` asserts it for every case.

There is deliberately no floor here
-----------------------------------
A target on a held-out set is an instruction to tune against it, which destroys
the only property that makes the set worth having. The test pins the
measurement **exactly**, in both directions, so a change that moves it either
way has to say so in the same commit — and it does not assert the number is
good. If a later change improves this rate by adding patterns keyed to these
exact strings, the set has stopped measuring generalisation and the right
response is a structural change plus a *new* held-out set, not a pattern per
miss.
