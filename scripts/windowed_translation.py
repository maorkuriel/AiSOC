"""The `det-*` rules that need a window, and what became of each one.

Why this file exists
--------------------
``scripts/check_detection_fields.py`` attributes 74 engine-loaded rules to a
"windowed evaluator" family. The windowed engine has existed since Wave 2 and
the exporter beside this file has shipped rules into it, but the two corpora
were disjoint: not one ``wd-*`` id corresponded to a ``det-*`` rule, so
building the engine moved none of these rules and the unreachable count never
changed. Each of the 74 still names a counter no connector emits
(``fail_count``, ``events_per_minute``, ``distinct_secrets_per_minute``),
reads ``None`` on its first clause, and can never fire — while being loaded by
the engine and counted toward the published executable total.

This module records one decision per rule, and the decision is the unit of
work: either the rule is translated into windowed form, or it is refused with
a reason. Nothing may simply disappear. ``scripts/check_windowed_translation.py``
enforces that, and ``scripts/export_detection_ruleset.py`` reads it so a
decided rule leaves the stateless corpus it could never fire in.

How a translation is derived
----------------------------
**From the rule's own clauses, never invented.** A rule like

    {"event_type": "user.session.start", "outcome": "FAILURE",
     "fail_count_gt": 20, "time_window_minutes_lt": 10}

already carries everything a windowed rule needs: the selector is what is left
after the counting and window clauses are removed, the threshold is the ``_gt``
bound plus one, and the window is the time clause. :func:`derive` computes all
three, so a translated rule cannot drift from the number its author chose, and
``check_windowed_translation.py`` re-derives them to prove it.

The one thing the clauses do not always carry is the entity the count
accumulates against. ``request_count_per_src`` names it; ``fail_count`` does
not. Where the name carries no entity the table below supplies one, and the
choice is a field the rule's own source emits rather than a plausible-looking
name — a ``group_by`` nothing emits is the same defect in a new place, because
``fields.get(group_by)`` returns ``None`` and the engine skips the event.

Why some rules are refused
--------------------------
The windowed engine is deliberately narrow: match, group by one entity, count
events or distinct values, threshold, window. It computes no sums, no means,
no variances, and it fires when a count is **high**. A rule that needs any of
those cannot be expressed here, and half-translating it — keeping the count
and dropping the mean — ships something that detects a different thing under
the original's name and severity. Those are refused with the reason stated, and
the refusal travels into the rule's YAML and its marketplace entry so a reader
of the catalogue sees why the rule does not run.

Refusal is not deletion. A refused rule keeps its id, its YAML and its place
in the corpus; it stops being counted as executable, which it never was.
