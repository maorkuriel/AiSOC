"""Every connector type names an OCSF class, or says why it does not.

Why this exists
---------------
``should_promote()`` in ``services/fusion/app/services/promoter.py`` promotes
an event to an alert when it is OCSF **category 2** (Findings) *or* its
``severity_id`` is at least 4. The category is the class uid divided by a
thousand, so the class a connector's events carry decides whether its routine
telemetry reaches an analyst's queue or stays in the lake.

Before the table this gate reads, 72 of the 84 declared connector types had no
class of their own. They fell to the ``2001`` Security Finding default inside
``canonicalProfile()`` — category 2, therefore **always promoted** — and that
default was invisible: nothing named it, nothing counted it, and no reviewer
saw a list of the sources it covered.

For the connectors whose ``fetch_alerts`` really does return the vendor's own
findings, 2001 is right. For the ones returning raw telemetry it meant every
permitted DNS lookup, every allowed proxy request, every accepted VPC flow
record and every routine Windows event became an alert carrying severity
``info`` — fusion's alert-reduction property inverted, for the sources that
emit the most volume. Reproduced on the pre-fix tree by
``TestRoutineTelemetryWasPromotedBeforeTheClassTable`` in the normalizer's own
suite.

What it checks
--------------
Two directions, because a one-directional check is this repository's dominant
gate defect — it compares A against B, never B against A, so drift in the
direction things actually change slips past while the gate prints OK.

  PY -> GO    every ``connector_id`` the connectors service declares has
              either a class mapping or a recorded reason it stays on the
              default. Neither is the failure this gate exists for.
  GO -> PY    every entry in the Go table names a connector that exists, no
              entry carries both a class and a reason, and no entry names a
              class uid absent from the service's own closed set.
  SCHEMA      every class in that closed set declares the category its uid
              implies, so a typo cannot change which promotion branch a
              connector's events take.
  PROMOTION   every class a connector is mapped to can actually promote: it
              is category 2, or the profile carrying it ships a severity map
              that reaches the floor of 4. A new class with an empty severity
              map is archived to the lake and never alerts, silently, which is
              exactly how the borrowed ``splunk_enterprise`` profile broke 26
              connectors.

It also reports the **count of connector types on the generic mapping**, which
is the figure the depth plan's Phase 2 is graded against, and holds it with
``--check`` against the committed number so it can only go down by a decision
somebody made rather than drift up by accident.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/check_ocsf_class_coverage.py              # gate
    python3 scripts/check_ocsf_class_coverage.py --check      # + drift on the count
    python3 scripts/check_ocsf_class_coverage.py --json
    python3 scripts/check_ocsf_class_coverage.py --self-test   # prove it bites

``--repo-root`` overrides the tree under inspection. The resolved root, every
file read and every count are printed before the verdict, and an empty read is
a hard error rather than a quiet zero.
