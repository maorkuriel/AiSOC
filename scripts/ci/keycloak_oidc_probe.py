"""Verify a real Keycloak `id_token` with the API's own verification code.

Fix pass 4.1. Driven by `.github/workflows/sso-live.yml`.

Read the caveat before citing this
-----------------------------------
This does **not** prove "a user signed in through Keycloak". There is no
browser here, so the authorization hop — redirect, consent, callback — is
not exercised; `tests/isolation/test_sso_live.py` covers that against a
provider this repository controls.

What it does prove is the half a self-authored provider cannot: that
`app.auth.oidc._verify_id_token` accepts a token minted by a real identity
provider, resolved through that provider's real discovery document and
real JWKS, with a real `kid`. Every defect of the "our fake was more
capable than the vendor" family lives in that gap.

The negative control is in the file rather than the workflow because it
needs the same realm: after the positive check, the same token is
re-verified against a *different* expected audience and must be refused.
A verifier that accepted anything would pass the positive check alone.
