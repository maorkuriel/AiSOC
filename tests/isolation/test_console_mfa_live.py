"""A second factor on the desktop console, through the real app and real Postgres.

Fix pass 4.2.

What was missing
----------------
Everything. `POST /api/v1/auth/login` verified a password and returned a
token pair, and there was no way for a user to add a second factor or for
a tenant to require one. Passkeys existed, on `/responder/*` only — the
mobile PWA — so the surface an analyst actually works from all day was
single-factor and no administrator could change that.

Why this suite is live rather than offline
-------------------------------------------
The property is "a correct password is not enough", and the only thing
that can demonstrate it is the real login route, against the real user
row, with the real password hash. A fake session that answers whatever
the handler asks cannot: it would return a user with whatever MFA state
the test wrote into the double, which is the shape that has shipped
defects in this repository before.

`ENVIRONMENT=test` and not `development`: `development` is in
`AUTH_BYPASS_ENVIRONMENTS`, so an uncredentialed request resolves to a
demo administrator — in the one suite whose whole subject is what it
takes to become a principal.

The negative controls
---------------------
Three, because the positive assertions have three different ways of
passing for the wrong reason:

* `test_a_wrong_code_is_refused` — a verifier that accepted any six
  digits would satisfy every "signs in" assertion here.
* `test_a_recovery_code_cannot_be_used_twice` — a single-use code that
  is not actually consumed is a password that never expires.
* `test_another_tenants_admin_cannot_reset_this_users_factor` — an admin
  reset is the designed way to remove somebody's second factor, so it is
  also the way to remove somebody *else's*.
