"""SCIM provisioning against the real application and a real Postgres.

Maturity: the evidence that takes **SCIM 2.0, white-label, usage
metering** to Stable.
See `docs/audit/MATURITY_DEFINITION.md` for what the label requires.

Why the offline suite is not enough
------------------------------------
`services/api/tests/test_scim_provisioning.py` is 40 good tests and two
things about its harness make it unable to certify this capability:

**It runs on `sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:` with `@compiles` shims** that
translate `JSONB`, `UUID`, `INET` and `ARRAY` into something SQLite will
accept. Those four types are where Postgres and SQLite disagree most, and
a shim that makes a column *accept* a value is not evidence the real
column stores or queries it. This repository has already shipped one
defect of exactly that shape — a query naming two columns the table does
not have, green across thirty tests against a fake.

**It builds its own `FastAPI()` and mounts the router alone.** So the
production middleware stack, the exception handlers and the real
dependency overrides are not what the assertions run through. A 401 that
the app's own handler would turn into a SCIM-shaped error body is not
exercised.

This suite uses `app.main:create_application` and real Postgres, so the
types, the constraints, the middleware and the auth are the ones a
deployment runs.

What it covers, and why the three additions matter
---------------------------------------------------
Create, list and discovery were here from the start. PATCH, group
membership and deactivation were not, and those are the three operations
whose correctness depends on the things SQLite cannot reproduce:

* **PATCH** is how both providers deactivate, and the two send the value
  in incompatible shapes — Okta an object with no `path` and a lowercase
  `op`, Entra an explicit `path` and the *string* `"False"`, for which
  `bool("False")` is `True`. The effect is a write to `users.is_active`
  and a `TIMESTAMPTZ` stamp, neither of which a shimmed column proves.
* **Group membership** writes `aisoc_scim_group_members`, a composite
  primary key over two `UUID` columns with cascading foreign keys. The
  offline harness compiles both types away, and the two providers remove
  a member in opposite arrangements (Okta through a path filter with no
  value, Entra with `path: "members"` and the id in a value array).
* **Deactivation** is the one that has to be true: it revokes API keys by
  count, stamps `sessions_revoked_at`, and `DELETE` must deactivate
  rather than erase. The whole point is a row that survives with access
  withdrawn, which only a real foreign-key graph can demonstrate.

The negative control
--------------------
`test_an_unauthenticated_request_is_refused` and
`test_another_tenants_token_cannot_read_these_users` are what stop the
positive assertions passing for the wrong reason: a surface that returned
everything to everyone would satisfy "the user I created is listed".
`TestGroupsAreTenantScoped` does the same for the group surface, which has
its own list handler and would not be covered by the user one.
